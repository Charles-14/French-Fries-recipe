1) 'On' the stove and place a medium sized pan on it.
2) put about 2 bowl oil or as required so that it can cover  3/4 of the pan || fill the pan with 3/4 amount of oil in it
3) cut  as many potatoes as you want into long chopped slices and put them into the pan so that they can fry in the oil
4) let the sliced potatoes be in the pan until they are golden brown in colour
5) when they have fried remove them and place them in a bowl covered with tissue paper so that all the access oil can drain out of the french fries 
6) when all the oil is drained out of the french fries and they look crispy sprinkle about 1/4 teaspoon of salt on the french fries and add about 1/2 teaspoon of chilli power or pepper power on the french fries and mix well
7) When they are mixed well and taste as you wished then they are read to serve on the table.
